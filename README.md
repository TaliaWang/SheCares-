Project: shecares.space

This project was developed at DeltaHacks VI with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Firebase, and Google Maps.

As a team of 3 girls who have personal experience with negative stereotypes surrounding women's health, we wanted to create a site that would help women easily find the health products they need. Through an anonymous website that conveniently compiles the top products for many different issues, we hoped to reduce female users' stress in caring for their health.

I worked on implementing a non-relational Firebase database and the Google Maps JavaScript API to dynamically load product information into our site and display local health clinics in the GTA.
